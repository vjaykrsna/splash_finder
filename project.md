# Internship Task: MERN + OAuth Project -- Image Search & Multi-Select

## Objective
Build a real-world full-stack project using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and
OAuth authentication. This task evaluates your understanding of authentication, frontend/backend integration,
and data management.

## Project Goal
- Only authenticated users can search images.
- Search results are fetched from Unsplash API.
- Results are displayed in a multi-select grid format.
- Users can view top searches across all users.
- Each user has a personal search history.

## Functional Requirements
1. Authentication
Use OAuth login via Google, Facebook, and GitHub using Passport.js. Only logged-in users can search or
view their history.
2. Top Searches Banner
API: GET /api/top-searches
Display top 5 most frequent search terms across all users. Show this as a banner at the top of the app.
3. Search Functionality
API: POST /api/search with { term }
Backend:
- Store { userId, term, timestamp } in MongoDB.
- Call Unsplash Search API and return image results.
Frontend:
- Show "You searched for X' -- N results."
- Display images in a 4-column grid.
- Overlay each image with a checkbox for multi-select.
4. Multi-Select Counter
Track selected images using client-side state. Display a dynamic counter like: "Selected: X images" above
the grid.
5. User's Search History
API: GET /api/history
Show the logged-in user's past search terms with timestamps. Can be shown in a sidebar or below the
results.

## Project Structure
/client (React frontend)
/server (Express backend)

## Deliverables
1. GitHub Repository with:
- Full code for /client and /server.
- OAuth + Unsplash integration.
2. README File including:
- Setup instructions (with .env details for Unsplash API and OAuth keys).
- Explanation of folder structure.
- Postman Collection or cURL examples for all API endpoints.
3. Visual Proof (in the repo or attached):
- Screenshots/GIFs of:
- OAuth login
- Top Searches banner
- Search results + multi-select
- Search history section
